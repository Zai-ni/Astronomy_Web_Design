            <h2>Home Page</h2>
            <p>I have designed the logo, homepage with a navigation bar, and a footer that includes a back-to-top function. The homepage also has a video with play/pause functionality, providing a brief explanation of other content pages and linking to those pages.I have also created an External CSS file that contains the CSS for Font ,the background, navigation bar, and footer.</p>

            <h2>Comments Page</h2>
            <p>I have designed the comments page using the form function. The form contains a rating section that uses radio buttons, a text area that asks for the reason behind the rating, and two optional drop-down menus that inquire about the current and future approaches. There are two buttons: one for submitting and one for resetting the form. </p>
