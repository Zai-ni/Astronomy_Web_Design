This colossal storm, comparable in size to Earth, intermittently vanishes and reappears, revealing the ever-changing and dynamic nature of Neptune's atmosphere. The planet also showcases various other atmospheric phenomena, including bright and dark bands, clouds, and storms, captivating astronomers and planetary scientists alike.</p>
            <p>Home to 14 confirmed natural satellites, Neptune's diverse array of moons includes Triton, the most notable among them. This icy moon orbits Neptune in a retrograde direction, suggesting that it was likely captured by Neptune's gravity and not formed with the planet. Triton's intriguing features, such as erupting nitrogen gas geysers and dark streaks, add to the allure of Neptune's moons and provide valuable insights into the planet's early history and formation.</p>
            <p>Located at an average distance of approximately 4.5 billion kilometers from the Sun, Neptune remains a mysterious and enticing celestial body. Due to its vast distance, exploring Neptune in detail poses significant challenges for space missions. Nonetheless, astronomers persevere in their study of this distant ice giant, seeking to unravel its mysteries and enhance our understanding of the formation and evolution of our solar system and the vast universe beyond.</p>

          <h1>Pluto</h1>
            <img src="Pluto.png" alt="Pluto">
            <p>Pluto, formerly regarded as the ninth planet in our solar system, is a small and enigmatic celestial body found in the outer reaches of the Kuiper Belt. Measuring around 2,377 kilometers in diameter, Pluto is noticeably smaller compared to both the inner planets and some of the larger moons in our solar system. Initially discovered in 1930 by astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, Pluto's status as a planet was reassessed in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) due to its distinct characteristics. Consequently, it was reclassified as a "dwarf planet," and it shares its orbital region with other icy objects beyond Neptune.</p>
            <p>Among these neighboring objects, Charon, its largest moon, stands out, being approximately half the size of Pluto itself. Pluto's surface is captivating and varied, displaying vast icy plains, mountainous areas, and frozen nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide ices. Adding to the intrigue, there exists a thin atmosphere primarily composed of nitrogen with traces of methane and carbon monoxide.</p>
            <p>Pluto's highly elliptical orbit results in significant variations in its distance from the Sun, leading to substantial temperature fluctuations on its surface. While the New Horizons spacecraft gathered valuable data during its flyby in 2015, there remains much to uncover about Pluto. Its exploration has sparked fascinating inquiries into the origins and development of icy bodies within the Kuiper Belt, fueling our curiosity about the most distant reaches of our solar system.</p>
