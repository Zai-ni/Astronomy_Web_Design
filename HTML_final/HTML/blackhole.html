            Black holes are areas of space where gravity is so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape from them. It is a result of Einstein's general relativity theory. Black holes are created when an object's mass is crushed into a space that is smaller than its gravitational radius. They originate from the collapse of enormous stars or even from the creation of the universe.<br><br>
            Primordial, stellar, and supermassive black holes are the three main types of black hole.<br><br>
            It is thought that the first black holes were quite small, with masses compacted into a narrow area that were comparable to a massive mountain. Stellar black holes are created when huge stars collide with one another, causing a supernova explosion and a dense core to remain behind. These black holes can be as massive as 20 times the Sun and can be contained within a sphere with a diameter of around 10 miles. Numerous star black holes are thought to be present in the Milky Way galaxy.<br><br>
            The biggest black holes are supermassive ones, with masses greater than millions or billions of suns. There is evidence to imply that every huge galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its heart, and they are believed to have formed together with the galaxies they are found in. Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole in the heart of our Milky Way galaxy, has a mass that is roughly 4 million times that of the Sun. It would occupy a sphere around the same size as the Sun.<br><br>
            Since all light is drawn into the centers of black holes by their intense gravitational attraction, they are invisible to the naked eye. Scientists can, however, see how they affect the stars and gases in the area. Black holes are discovered through indirect means, such as by watching the behavior of nearby matter and stars. Black holes can be detected, for instance, by the unpredictable movements of their surroundings or by the star's orbital patterns. Black holes can also be recognized by their interactions with the material they are surrounded by, as they can produce high-energy photons and have accretion disks that emit X-rays.<br><br>
            Astronomers can learn more about the features and characteristics of black holes by examining the gravitational forces and radiation produced when matter enters one.<br><br>
